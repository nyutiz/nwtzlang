## ‼️ THERE IS MANY BUGS WHICH I WILL SOLVE OR YOU CAN BUT DONT USE IT **NOW** IN YOUR PROJECT ‼️

### (Honestly I publish it just to use it in another project which is (for now) private, a lot of features a not implemented)

### Maybe I will make a real doc one day... 

# A New Interpreted Programming Language called NWTZ lang

Written in Rust, this new interpreted language aims to provide **seamless importation from other programming languages such as Python, Java, or C libraries, making it a multi-purpose utility language. For machine learning, commutation etc.** (not implemented)

## Goals & Planned Features

- Import system for external libraries (Python, Java, C, etc.)

- Looping constructs (e.g., for, while)

- Object types for basic OOP support

- Array/List structures similar to Lua


I haven't updated the snd grammar with the current changes but it's still a basis for this project

I want this language to be able to help projects, especially by its simplicity and I would like to implement algorithms that would speed up calculations and manipulate data easily while being portable, secure and multiplatform and in the future make a WORA like java.
