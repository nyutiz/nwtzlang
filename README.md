# A New Interpreted Programming Language called NWTZ lang

Written in Rust, this new interpreted language aims to provide **seamless importation from other programming languages such as Python, Java, or C libraries, making it a multi-purpose utility language. For machine learning, commutation etc.**


## Goals & Planned Features

- Import system for external libraries (Python, Java, C, etc.)

- Looping constructs (e.g., for, while)

- Object types for basic OOP support

- Array/List structures similar to Lua
